# Regular Flolloping

Post-Netrunner Rotation, currently hosted at [Protocol Seven](https://anr.p7.co.nz)

## Getting Started

What you need to get the generator up and running.

### Prerequisites

Built using Nix.
Nix can be installed with:  
```
curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```  

### Dependencies

`imagemagick` is required for the favicons.

### Installing

Compile the generator

```
nix-build p7.nix
```  

Enter the build environment

```
nix-shell --pure
```

Generate the site

```
./result/site rebuild
```

And test it out

```
./result/site watch
```

The site will now be avaliable at `localhost:8000`

## Deployment

Site will be completely static, so simply point your server to the `_site` directory
